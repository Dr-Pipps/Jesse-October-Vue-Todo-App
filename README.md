# Jesse-October-Vue-Todo-App
Using what you have learned about the Vue framework, create a Todo app solely focused on Vue and it's functionality. Making use of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you've acquired from the previous courses. You must make effective use of Vue's Object-Oriented Programming system to build your application, as a result, plan it thoroughly before you start with coding.        In order for the data, your user creates for their app experience to persist, make use of Vue's OOP system to store the data you use inside of sessionStorage and(or) localStorage.  When storing and creating data to be saved make sure you are using the JSON format.
