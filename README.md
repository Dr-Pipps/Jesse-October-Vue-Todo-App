# Jesse-October-Vue-Todo-App
Using what you have learned about the Vue framework, create a Todo app solely focused on Vue and it's functionality. Making use of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you've acquired from the previous courses. You must make effective use of Vue's Object-Oriented Programming system to build your application, as a result, plan it thoroughly before you start with coding.        In order for the data, your user creates for their app experience to persist, make use of Vue's OOP system to store the data you use inside of sessionStorage and(or) localStorage.  When storing and creating data to be saved make sure you are using the JSON format. 

Focus firstly on making sure your app is functional, by creating Vue features that allow your app to do the following:

  

• Add tasks to the list

• Delete tasks from the list

• Edit tasks

• Add due dates to tasks

• Sort tasks alphabetically

• Strike through tasks on the list

• Add categories to a task and utilize all the above features that the tasks has

• Add priority to a task

• Sort tasks by priority

• Save tasks in their expected states and order even after the browser has been closed

 

 

Bonus:

• Color each task by their priority

• Add a reminder option on a task
